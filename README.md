# Password Manager
Authored by Adam Shay

## Description
This project is a simple Password Manager GUI application built using the Tkinter library in Python.
The Password Manager allows users to generate strong passwords, save them securely, and retrieve them when needed.

## Features
### Password Generator
The Password Manager includes a password generator that creates strong and random passwords.
It combines letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols to enhance password security.

### Save Passwords
Users can save their login credentials (website, email, and password) securely.
The saved passwords are stored in a JSON file named "Saved Passwords.json" in the same directory as the script.

### Search Functionality
The application allows users to search for a specific website's login details.
If the details are saved, the user can retrieve the associated email and password.
